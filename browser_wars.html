            The first browser NCSA Mosaic
        </h2>
        <p>
            After the birth of the world wide web in 1989, it was clear that the internet will be the next big thing, a
            worldwide phenomenon carrying a trillions of dollars of commerce. However, in 1992, there were still only 50
            web pages on the internet. If the World Wide Web made the internet more accessible. Another development
            rocketed it to near instantaneous acceptance by people far and wide this was a very user friendly software
            used to browse the World Wide Web. It was 1993, at the NCSA at University of Illinois, Marc Andreessen and a
            team of students and researchers introduced NCSA Mosaic to the mass public. Mosaic offered a user-friendly
            way to search the Web: It allowed users to see words and pictures on the same page for the first time and to
            navigate using scrollbars and clickable links.

        <h2>
            The birth of Netscape Navigator
        </h2>
        <p>
            Marc was later contacted by James H. Clark, a notable Silicon Valley investor, entrepreneur and computer
            scientist. He was looking for his next big investment and the idea of an universally accessible browser
            caught his eyes. They later went on to found Netscape Communications Corporation (originally Mosaic
            Communications Corporation), where Netscape Navigator was created. It was an instant runaway success. The
            web was spreading like a wildfire around the globe. The Internet age had truly begun.

            Microsoft’s “monopoly”
        </h3>
        <p>
            At the time, Microsoft was the most important and fantastically profitable high tech company of them all.
            After two decades Microsoft had established a near monopoly over PC operating systems and it used that
            monopoly to gain a vice-like grip over the entire computer industry. About 90% of the world's PCs were
            running Microsoft Windows; this spectacular success had turned Microsoft into a veritable money machine
            raking in billions of dollars in profits and turning thousands of Microsoft employees into stock option
            millionaires. Bill Gates thought that the information highway should be a toll road, on which Microsoft
            controlled all the toll booths, we would all have to pay to drive. A future where the browser could be an
            alternative platform where you could carry out all your computing needs online thereby leveling the playing
            field is suddenly becoming possible.

        <h3>
            Two Sides of the Story
        </h3>
        <p>
            A meeting was conducted between a team from Microsoft and Netscape taking place in Netscape the headquarters
            in the valley. It remains one of the most controversial meetings in modern business and is still a subject
            of intense and bitter debate. According to Microsoft, it was more of a Joe easygoing meeting with free
            roaming discussions. But Netscape's version of events was just a little bit different as Microsoft came in
            and offered to buy all of their technology for 1 million dollars or they would drive Netscape out of
            business. Some may suspect there was a violation of the US Antitrust Law.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Netscape Went Public
        </h2>
        <p>
            Netscape went public after just one year of establishment. On the day of the IPO Netscape stock went through
            the roof, igniting the internet boom that would rage for the rest of the decade. James Clark invested 5
            million dollars into Netscape and made 663 million dollars on the day of the IPO closing. Andressen then
            went public to show his stance on the rivalry with Microsoft, preferring to the company’s most important
            product Windows as “a set of poorly debug device drivers”.

            Microsoft vs Netscape War

        <h3>
            Microsoft’s Pearl Harbor’s Day
        </h3>
        <p>
            December 7th, 1995, Microsoft hastily arranged a press and analysts meeting in Seattle. They did it on the
            anniversary of the
            attack on Pearl Harbor and it was called the Pearl Harbor day. The view was they were going to attack
            Netscape with all that they could building a new web browser called the Internet Explorer.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Full Force War
        </h3>
        <p>
            Gates had pulled out all the stops pouring millions of dollars into the web and turning Internet Explorer
            into a do or die cause at Microsoft. Suddenly, Netscape was about to find themselves in the world of
            troubles. Despite Netscape's headstart Microsoft's Internet Explorer team had some real advantages with vast
            financial resources and reserves of coding talent and a leader of Bill Gates. Microsoft's plan was
            straightforward: analyze Netscape's every move and imitate it, release version after version of Internet
            Explorer and slowly chip away at Netscape's lead in browser market share one percentage point at a time. The
            engineering team was going all out working as if their lives depended on it. At the same time, Microsoft’s
            army of silent salesmen had a mission, to stop PC manufacturers from installing anything other than Internet
            Explorer. As both companies went head-to-head with version after version of their browsers the market share
            of Internet Explorer steadily grew and Netscape’s started to drop. Rather than charging money for its web
            browser his Netscape had to Microsoft was able to give Internet Explorer away for free bundled and
            seamlessly integrated into the Windows operating system, and that was a fatal hit for Netscape.

        <h3>
            The Fall of the Underdog
        </h3>
        <p>
            From that point on, it was all downhill for Netscape. A year later its market
            share now and single figures and dwindling. The company that ushered in the Internet age was acquired by a
            bigger but slower company, AOL.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Microsoft vs The US government
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 1998, the United States Department of Justice prodded by Microsoft's enemies in Silicon Valley and
            particularly by Netscape launched a historic antitrust lawsuit against Bill Gates's company. The government
            has accused Microsoft of using its Windows monopoly to engage in a wide variety of predatory and
            exclusionary business practices to prevent consumers from accessing Netscape's products and thus to put the
            pioneering start up six feet under. Federal judge in charge of the Microsoft case issued his final verdict
            as guilty. Microsoft’s stock market value to plunge by thirty billion dollars overnight. Gates handed over
            the CEO chair to his partner Steve Balmer and began to focus more on his philanthropic works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Microsoft won the browser war, the revolution sparked by Netscape unleashed a new generation of
            startups companies like Google that have made Microsoft look old and clueless. A lesson of the high tech
            world has been proven true and even the most powerful empires to disappear in one click.
