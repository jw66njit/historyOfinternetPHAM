            The Sputnik Scare
        </h2>
        <p>
            However, it’s a frightening display of Soviet scientific superiority during the Cold War spurred them into teamwork. On October 4th, 1957 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, a satellite which relayed blips and bleeps from its radio transmitters as it circled the Earth. To catch up and hopefully surpass the Soviets in space technology, President Eisenhower created the bureau at the Defense Department called ARPA the Advanced Research Projects Agency. It was in charge of the space program which then included computer science. Computer communication was in the embryonic stage but it was making progress. At MIT a graduate student named Leonard Kleinrock began applying queueing theory to data transmission.        </p>

            APRAnet
        </h2>
        <p>
            The seminal idea of the internet was envisioned by a psychologist, scientist and professor at MIT named Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider. In the 1950s, Licklider’s vision was that connecting all of the computers together would allow you to communicate and share information better. Computer communication was a flight of imagination far beyond anything at the movies.
            In the 1960s, America needed an indestructible communications network in the preparation of the Cold War. Paul Baran was hired to see if one could be built.

        <h3>
            Packet switching
        </h3>
        <p>
            Baran was considering a fishing net design and came up with hot potato routing. Hot potato routing meant a message transiting through a network got to where it was going even if part of the network was destroyed. He was inspired by a previous study of mice in a maze by Carl Shannon in 1952. Then borrowing an idea from the telegraph Baran decided to chop up each message into small equal sized pieces called packets, each packet was like a postcard with a to and a from address.
            Donald Davies at the National Physics Laboratory in the UK independently developed a similar message routing concept in 1965. He coined the term “packet switching”, and proposed building a nationwide network in the UK.
            By 1962, there was enough research and theory to show that a viable computer network could be built but implementing one had to wait seven years until 1969.

        <h3>
            The building of ARPAnet
        </h3>
        <p>
            In 1966, Bob Taylor of ARPA needed a separate terminal to log
            into each of several time shared computers at research centers across the country. Taylor recruited Larry Roberts for the job. Roberts had built the world's first experimental connection between two
            computers at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts. 1968 also was the year Larry Roberts sought out the engineers to build the Advanced Research Projects Agency’s computer network called the ARPANET. It was going to be based on special-purpose mini computers called Interface Message Processors or IMPs and packet switching.

            On September 1st 1969 the first piece of hardware created for the computer network that was the forerunner of the internet arrived at UCLA. by the end of 1969 all four sites were interconnected. In April 1971, the ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers hooked into the network.

            The invention of electrical mailing application
        </h3>
        <p>
            At first, there wasn't much to do on the ARPANET beyond transferring data files among its members but then a new capability was added the first killer application that would bring in the masses and take the usefulness of computer networking to a new level that killer app was email.
            Raymond Tomlinson was working on a mail program but it was programmed for a single computer so that you can send emails to yourself or other users on the sharing computer. He realized that the mailbox he was sending these emails to was a file and tried to send that file across the network instead of keeping it within the same machine. He modified the code and the first email program was created.

            The TCP/IP Protocol
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 1973, Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn teamed up to develop a set of rules or procedures known as the TCP/IP protocol which if followed by different computer networks would allow them to pass their message packets back and forth. The TCP/IP protocol enabled the networks to interconnect. Cerf and Kahn called the computer in the network that would know the protocol and thus be able to communicate across networks the Gateway. In 1983, after ten years of refinement and bureaucratic haggling TCP/IP was adopted as the universal standard marking a milestone in the development of the Internet, a common network of interconnected networks.

            The World Wide Web
        </h2>
        <h3>
            The birth of WWW
        </h3>
        <p>
            In 1991, the internet changed again. That year, a computer programmer in Switzerland named Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web: an internet that was not simply a way to send files from one place to another but was itself a “web” of information that anyone on the Internet could retrieve. Berners-Lee created the Internet that we know today.

            The Congress Bill
        </h3>
        <p>
            On June 9th 1992, Congress passed a bill taking the internet out of the exclusive hands of government and into the public.The following November President Bush signed it into law. That unleashed a lot of commercial energy and competition and progress by allowing free enterprise and individuals to access the Internet. The seeds were planted that would flourish into many new and previously unimaginable developments.

        <h3>
            The First Browser
        </h3>
        <p>
            In 1993, a group of students and researchers at the University of Illinois developed a sophisticated browser that they called Mosaic. (It later became Netscape.) Mosaic offered a user-friendly way to search the Web: It allowed users to see words and pictures on the same page for the first time and to navigate using scrollbars and clickable links.
