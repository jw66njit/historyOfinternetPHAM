            Ebay and Amazon
        </p>
        <p>
            The exponential growth in e-commerce was shown by online marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon. Amazon created a system of secure online transactions to encrypt credit card numbers and eBay brought together collectors on their auction site. Customers quickly adapted to online shopping and in 1997, eBay and Amazon went public. EBay founder Pierre Omidyar became a billionaire after their IPO, and Amazon laid their foundation for future dominance. According to Moore’s Law, the speed and power of hardware would double every 18 months. Internet users grew to 50 million in 4 years, and with the self accelerating advancement of technology, a new age of the Internet Revolution was on the rise.         </p>

        <p>
            Amazon established Public Key Cryptography to create secure online credit card transactions. Amazon focused on undercutting brick and mortar competitors,sacrificing short term revenue,  in order to create a large customer base. The success of eBay and Amazon’s IPO gave rise to an Internet boom where money was being heavily invested into dot com businesses. Businessmen moved to silicon valley to invest in these new companies in hope for the next big thing. The internet also gave access to online day trading, allowing anyone with a computer to invest in stocks.

        <p>
            In 1999, internet companies rose from 30 to 250 companies. The internet boom created a need for more bandwidth, and telecommunications companies were in the race to lay down as many fiber optics cables as possible. These fiber optic cables work like a highway to transfer data between computers        </p>

            Dot Com Crash
        </p>
        <p>
            Dot com company stocks were being pushed without real business plans and the dot com bubble came to a crash in 2001. The stock market faced its biggest loss at 25%. The US Securities Commision tackled Wall Street for stock manipulation and reformed IPO’s in the stock market. Although investors suffered from the crash, the dot com bubble laid the foundations for internet infrastructure and customer databases. It also became a requirement for businesses to have websites.
