            Online communication
        </h2>
        <p>
            The internet gave rise to modern day media and created a medium for people to create competition to big media. Youtube, founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, created a form of communication that allowed sharing of user created content. Digg, founded by Kevin Rose, Owen Byrne, Ron Gorodetzky, and Jay Adelson, created a competition to big media journalism that allowed its community to vote on which articles they enjoyed.         </p>
        <h2>
            File Sharing
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 1999 Napster, founded by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, disrupted the music industry by creating a platform for users to download free music. In 2001, Napster faced legal issues with the music industry and was forced to shut down. This influenced Apple to launch iTunes, which sold music for 99 cents while protecting the intellectual property of music.        </p>
        <h2>
            Social Media
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 2003 Myspace, founded by Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson, launched the birth of social media. Myspace let users personalize their page and was used by everybody on the internet, including musicians.
            In 2004 Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, launched as a social media platform for Harvard students. Facebook focused on mapping out a social graph, which says that everyone is bound by a web of relationships. Facebook grew to 6 million users in a year and expanded from other universities before becoming accessible to everybody.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Internet for the community
        </h2>
        <p>
            Craigslist, founded by Craig Newmark, created a platform that resembled an online newspaper where users could find job listings, rentals, places to buy/sell/trade. In 2001 Jimmy Wales launched Wikipedia, a platform for users to contribute to the internet by sharing knowledge on different types of subjects.
