        <h2>
            Early days of the Internet
        </h2>
        <p>
            The early days of the internet were primarily used by university students and researchers. The internet consisted of pages of plain text links that users had to manually navigate to find useful information. Navigating the world wide web was a disorganized mess, and two graduate students from Stanford University took the opportunity to solve a problem.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Yahoo!
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 1994, Jerry Yang and David Filo launched their website “Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web”. The website was inspired by a Fantasy Basketball League that Jerry and David were competing in. They used the web to gather data in order to gain advantage in their decision making. They saw a need to organize the web and manually created a directory of websites with subcategories. The website was renamed “Yahoo!” and the user friendly interface introduced a large audience of new users.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Advertisement on the Internet
        </h2>
        <p>
            The internet was a new form of media and the users were split into people who viewed the internet as a place for education, and an opportunity for commercialization. Venture Capitalist Michael Moritz saw this audience as a target market and invested in Yahoo. Although Yahoo had a loyal user base, they had no revenue and needed to make money. In 1995, Yahoo launched their first banner advertisement. The fear of backlash from internet purists was conquered by growing users and the web boom began.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Birth of Google
        </h2>
        <p>
            Yahoo proved the internet as a form of business and the race for market dominance began. Excite, founded by Stanford students Graham Spencer, Joe Kraus, Mark VanHaren, Ryan McIntyre, Ben Lutch and Martin Reinfriedm, went head to head with Yahoo. Unlike Yahoo, whose search engine was organized manually by the founders, Excite used software to search for results containing relevant keywords. Yahoo and Excite were in extreme competition and expedited the innovation of the internet. They introduced new features for personalization, such as email and chat rooms, to retain audiences for their advertisements. The web pages became commercialized with clutters of advertisements and Yahoo and Excite diverged away from improving their search engine. The world wide web was expanding with information but the search engines were not keeping pace with accuracy.
            In 1996, Stanford students Larry Page, Sergei Brin, and Scott Hassan, worked on a new search engine for their graduate research project. This new search engine based their results based on the number of hits on a webpage, organizing the results according to relevancy. Vinod Khsola, an investor of Excite, arranged a meeting with Larry and Sergei of Google in hopes of acquiring their software. The consensus at the time was that the search engine technology would not give a high enough return on investment and Excite turned down acquiring Google for 1 million dollars. Google needed investors who believed in the future of their technology and received a 100,000 check from Andy Bechtolsheim, an investor introduced by their computer science professor, and other angel investors totaling 1 million. Google still needed more money and approached renowned Silicon Valley investor John Doerr and Michael Moritz. They saw the potential in Google’s software and each invested 12 million dollars. Although Google had 25 million dollars, their capital could not keep up with their growth in employees and equipment.

        <h2>
            Search Engines as Marketing Profiles
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 1998, Google solved this problem by taking Idealab’s overture.com business plan. Bill Gross, CEO of Idealab, came up with the idea of using search terms to create a customized marketing profile of the user. Google improved overture’s system by integrating advertisements into the search result interface, with a clear distinction between the two, to create a better user experience. Google perfected internet advertising and became the center of the internet economy. In 2004, Google had their Initial Public Offering at 85 dollars a share, reaching up to 700 dollars a share in 3 years. Google’s business plan extended to acquiring and adding features such as photo sharing, streaming, email, and social media. Google’s domination of the internet gave rise to e-commerce.
